# Fantasy Sports Automation Tool

This repository contains program created to automate our family fantasy sports league. Project is currently a work in progress.

## The goals for this project are as follows:

1. Scrape common stats sites for relevant information
   - Most likely using reference site
   - Alternative path is using downloaded CSV generated by fantasy site
2. Use that information to automate setting salary prices for fantasy league
   - Data must be imported into fantasy site as a CSV
   - CSV import has required formatting for sheet

## Stretch goals:

1. Use that data to create sheets to share
   - Google sheets will probably be the easiest as it could be shared with a link
2. Visualize the data in some meaningful way to share
   - Alternatively, charts and images are easy to understand so this may be better solution long term

## Completed work:

1. Creating data frames that can be used to work with that data or send to csv, sheets, or database
   - Probably also using Pandas to_csv feature, but more work needs to be done cleaning up and formatting data

## I'm currently working on:

1. Salary spreadsheet automation
   - Currently importing data from downloaded spreadsheet and generating salary amount from that
     data.
2. Generating output file that is formatted correctly to submit on fantasy site.
